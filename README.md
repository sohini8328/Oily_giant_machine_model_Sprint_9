New Well Location Prediction for OilyGiant Mining Company

The purpose of this project is to determine the optimal location for a new oil well for the OilyGiant Mining Company. Using advanced machine learning techniques, this project aims to identify locations with the highest oil volume and quality, maximizing revenue and contributing to the company's growth.

Conclusion
Key Findings
- Model Performance:- Among the top 200 wells, the model trained for Region 1 exhibited the lowest mean errors, making it the most accurate and reliable compared to the models for other regions.

- Sample Means:- Region 2: True mean falls between 118 and 128.
- Region 1: True mean falls between 115 and 120.
- Region 0: True mean falls between 107 and 116.

- Profit Analysis:- Region 1 has the highest profit, followed by Region 0, and then Region 2.
- The average profit also follows the same trend, with Region 1 being the most profitable.

- Loss Criteria:- Region 1 meets the stringent criterion of maintaining a loss below 2.5%.
- It has the highest average profit of 34,122, further solidifying its position as the best choice.


Recommendation
Based on these findings, Region 1 emerges as the most promising location for a new oil well. Its superior model performance, highest average profit, and minimal loss percentage make it the ideal strategic choice. This decision will directly contribute to OilyGiant's sustained success and growth in the competitive oil market.
